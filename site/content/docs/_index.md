# Lynx FIM Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **Lynx FIM**, a lightweight host-based intrusion detection agent built in Go. This site is organized into two primary sections to help you navigate the project.

## 🗺️ How to Use These Docs

### [🚀 Usage Guide]({{< relref "usage/installation.md" >}})
If you want to run Lynx FIM on your system, start here. This section covers:
-   **[Installation & Setup]({{< relref "usage/installation.md" >}})**: How to build the agent and configure webhooks.
-   **[General Features]({{< relref "usage/features.md" >}})**: An overview of the agent's capabilities.

### [💻 Development & Research]({{< relref "development/technical_specs.md" >}})
If you're interested in the "how" and "why" behind the tool, explore this section:
-   **[Technical Specifications]({{< relref "development/technical_specs.md" >}})**: My research into Go, Cryptography, and Kernel events.
-   **[Implementation Story]({{< relref "development/implementation_story.md" >}})**: A milestone-by-milestone log of my learning journey.
-   **[Implementation Plan]({{< relref "development/implementation_plan.md" >}})**: The original roadmap for Summer 2025.
-   **[Requirements]({{< relref "development/requirements.md" >}})**: What I defined as essential for a modern FIM.

> **Note:** This project is part of a 2-month intensive learning cycle from June to August 2025. I'm building this from scratch to truly understand the core concepts of system security.
